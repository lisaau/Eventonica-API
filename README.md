### Part 4

The project builds on part 1-3. In addition to an **object-oriented-programming** approach to set up the functionality, **jasmine** for unit testing, and **jQuery** for the UI, this part of the project focuses on utilizing **Ticketmaster's API** to add additional events to this app.

Note- this project includes a [simple static file server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework), `nodeServer.js`, without the use of a framework to demonstrate understanding of server-side programming. Running the app with this server will display the `404.html` file if the route does not exist.
