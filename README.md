# Eventonica with API Calls

Eventonica is a web app to manage events from Techtonica's curriculum outlined here: https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/master/projects/eventonica.

This includes API calls from Techtonica's [Part 4 - API's](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/projects/eventonica/eventonica-part4-apis.md) instructions to build on the [Eventonica project](https://github.com/lisaau/Eventonica).

### Project Design

This builds on the first phase of the project which can be viewed at https://github.com/lisaau/Eventonica

In addition to an **object-oriented-programming** approach to set up the functionality, **jasmine** for unit testing, and **jQuery** for the UI, this part of the project focuses on utilizing **Ticketmaster's API** to add additional events to this app.
